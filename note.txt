package.json:
    difference between depencencies and devDependencies:

vue sends everything back to client within a single javascript file,
client will render this js file and then display the content.
this is also called Client Side Rendered and also single page application.

in single page applications, only one js file will be sent back to client that will rewrite the content when parsed by client

style scoped? inside App.vue?
because we don't want style in App.vue affect other vue files.
by applying scoped to style of a vue file, it will only add that style to that specific vue file.

composition api > options api
<script setup>, setup will select composition api in vue.

next project will be a notes app.
we can use vue to show a modal page.
both html overly and modal window (div) must be created.
but initially the modal window div is hidden.
js code will be used to display the modal window, and dim the overlay.
for this we will use vue directives (v-if)

next project: quizes website

we use colon (:) right before html attributes to make them enable the use of javascript.

watch from vue is similar to useEffect in react. it will run some code, everytime a variable changes

splitting components into multiple files.
props.
routing, 3.30.00.

vue-router package will be used for routing.
Routing process:
1. define router in its own js file (routing rules)
2. import components inside it
3. export router object
4. import router object in main.js file and add it to app instance
5. define the routes as components in App.vue
6. the routes will be used to render components

never use anchor tags in vue program. that will refresh the entire page and foil the purpose of single page applications.
