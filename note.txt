vue sends everything back to client within a single javascript file,
client will render this js file and then display the content.
this is also called Client Side Rendered and also single page application.

in single page applications, only one js file will be sent back to client that will rewrite the content when parsed by client

because we don't want style in App.vue affect other vue files.
by applying scoped to style of a vue file, it will only add that style to that specific vue file.
