vue sends everything back to client within a single javascript file,
client will render this js file and then display the content.
this is also called Client Side Rendered and also single page application.

in single page applications, only one js file will be sent back to client that will rewrite the content when parsed by client

style scoped? inside App.vue?
because we don't want style in App.vue affect other vue files.
by applying scoped to style of a vue file, it will only add that style to that specific vue file.

composition api > options api
<script setup>, setup will select composition api in vue.

next project will be a notes app.
we can use vue to show a modal page.
both html overly and modal window (div) must be created.
but initially the modal window div is hidden.
js code will be used to display the modal window, and dim the overlay.
for this we will use vue directives (v-if)

next project: quizes website
